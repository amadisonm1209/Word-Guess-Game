# Word-Guess-Game

This is my first crack at using JavaScript to build a guessing game! The game is a simple Hangman game with a theme of "Coffee!"

To get started, press any letter key! Each word gives you 9 guesses that you lose when you guess a letter incorrectly. When you guess a word correctly, you will see your wins increase. The game will automatically give a different word upon completion of a round.
